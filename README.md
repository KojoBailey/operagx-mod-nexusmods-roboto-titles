# Opera GX Mod: Nexus Mods Roboto Titles
This mod changes the `<h1>` CSS font on **Nexus Mods** from "bebas_neuebook" to "Roboto".

This new font is easier to read, isn't forced to all-caps, and - in my oh so humble opinion - simply looks better.

## Installation
The mod is publicly available for download on [GX.store](https://store.gx.me/mods/9qdzga/better-nexus-mods-titles-font/) (for free).

You do, of course, need to have the Opera GX browser to use this.
